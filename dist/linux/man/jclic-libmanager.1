.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jclic-libmanager
.RI "[" OPTION "] [" NAME "] [" FILE "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes briefly the
.B jclic-library
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution. 
It only contains the description of the basic options. For full manuals and 
documentation please visit:

.BR JClic
is formed by a set of computer applications that are used for
carrying out different types of educational \fBactivities\fP: puzzles,
associations, text exercises, crosswords...
.br
If you want to check about how JClic projects are, you should take a look at:
.br
http://clic.xtec.cat/db/listact_en.jsp

JClic activities are packed in \fBJClic projects\fP. Projects are sets of
activities organized in one or more sequences, which indicate the order
in which they have to be shown.
.br
Projects can be organized into \fBJClic Libraries\fP. Libraries
are collections of \fBJClic projects\fP, often structured in folders and subfolders.
When JClic starts, it can automatically show the main library. When more than one library
is defined JClic shows a list, allowing users to select one.
.br
Each user can have its own JClic Library, usually placed in \fB~/JClic/projects\fP.
JClic libraries are encapsulated into XML files. These files are named "library.jclic"
by default.
.br
System-wide libraries can also be specified. These system-wide libraries are usually
"read-only", and shown to everyone without the need of per-user settings.

.BR JClic\ Library\ Manager
is a tool intended to be used by admin users to list, add and remove references to
JClic Libraries at system level. It should be called always as a superuser
(e.g.: "sudo jclic-libmanager -list")
