.BR JClic
is formed by a set of computer applications that are used for
carrying out different types of \fBeducational activities\fP: puzzles,
associations, text exercises, crosswords...
.br
These activities are  packed in \fBJClic projects\fP. A project is formed by a
set of activities and one or more sequences, which indicate the order
in which they have to be shown.
.br
Projects can be organized in \fBJClic Libraries\fP. Users can navigate into the
different sections and levels of a JClic Library, to found and launch a specifc project.
Each user can have its own JClic Library, usualy placed in \fB~/JClic/projects\fP.
JClic libraries are encapsulated into XML files, usually named "library.jclic".
.br
System-wide libraries can also be specified. These system-wide libraries,
when defined, are shown to all users when they start JClic.
When there are more than one system library, a menu is shown asking users
to select one.
If you want to test/get/know how JClic projects are you should take a
