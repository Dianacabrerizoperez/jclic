<a href="http://clic.xtec.cat">JClic</a> - Player and authoring tool for educational activities</h1>

<p>JClic is a set of cross-platform Java applications useful for creating and carrying out different types of educational activities like puzzles, associations, text exercises or crosswords.</p>

<p>JClic is an open source project of the Department of Education of the Government of Catalonia. Teachers from different countries have contributed since 1995 to create a big repository of educational activities, shared under Creative Commons licenses in the project's main site: <a href="http://clic.xtec.cat">http://clic.xtec.cat</a></p>

<p>The current components of JClic are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>JClic Player</strong>: Allows students to play with the activities and, optionally, track reports of their work in a local or remote database. The activities are organized into “projects” (files with extension .jclic.zip), and projects can be grouped into “Libraries”.</li>
<li>
<strong>JClic Applet</strong>: Is a variant of JClic Player designed to run embedded into HTML documents.</li>
<li>
<strong>JClic Author</strong>: Is a visual tool used by teachers and authors to create or modify activities and projects.</li>
<li>
<strong>JClic Reports</strong>: Is a reporting tool designed to collect and display the results (time, tries, guesses, success...) achieved by the students when playing JClic activities.</li>
<li>
<strong>JClic module for Moodle</strong>: Is a parallel project specifically designed for embedding JClic activities into the Moodle Virtual Learning Environment. This project lives in <a href="https://github.com/projectestac/moodle-mod_jclic">https://github.com/projectestac/moodle-mod_jclic</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>See INSTALL.txt for compilation instructions, and HACKING.txt if you want to set-up your own JClic development project with <a href="http://netbeans.org">Netbeans</a>.</p>
