<p style="color: Maroon; font-size: 16;"><b>Unable to detect any multimedia extension on your Java system!</b></P>
<p>JClic can play audio files in different formats (wav, au, mp3, ogg...), but it needs a
extension of the Java system in order to play video and other multimedia content, like flash movies.
</p>
<p>There is no multimedia extension currently installed on your Java system. You can continue without it (the multimedia files will be ignored), but it's advisable to install a extension in order to experience all the content of JClic activities. The installation process is easy, and must be done only once.</p>
<p>You can choose one of these two options: "QuickTime for Java" or "Java Media Framework".<br>
In both cases, please read carefully the provided instructions and restart all browsers and Java applications after the installation.</p>
<p style="color: navy; font-size: 14;"><b>Java Media Framework</b>
<hr>
Recommended option for Windows, Linux and other operating systems.</p>
<p>A basic set (only 2 Mb) of Java Media Framework for Windows can be downloaded from:
