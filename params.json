Teachers from different countries have contributed since 1995 to create a big repository of educational activities, shared under Creative Commons licenses in the project's main site: [http://clic.xtec.cat](http://clic.xtec.cat)\r\n\r\nThe current components of JClic are:\r\n\r\n- **JClic Player**: Allows students to play with the activities and, optionally, track reports of their work in a local or remote database. The activities are organized into “projects” (files with extension .jclic.zip), and projects can be grouped into “Libraries”.\r\n- **JClic Applet**: Is a variant of JClic Player designed to run embedded into HTML documents.\r\n- **JClic Author**: Is a visual tool used by teachers and authors to create or modify activities and projects.\r\n- **JClic Reports**: Is a reporting tool designed to collect and display the results (time, tries, guesses, success...) achieved by the students when playing JClic activities.\r\n- **JClic module for Moodle**: Is a parallel project specifically designed for embedding JClic activities into the Moodle Virtual Learning Environment. This project lives in [https://github.com/projectestac/moodle-mod_jclic](https://github.com/projectestac/moodle-mod_jclic)\r\n\r\nSee INSTALL.txt for compilation instructions, and HACKING.txt if you want to set-up your own JClic development project with [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
