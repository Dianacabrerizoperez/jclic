-----------------------------

This is just an INCOMPLETE, EMPTY and NO-OPERATIONAL implementation of the 
QuickTime(TM) for Java library, based on the public API available at: 
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Java/Reference/1.4.1/Java141API_QTJ

The files contained in this directory tree are used only at compile-time to make 
possible the build process of JClic without external dependencies. They will not be 
compiled, packaged nor included in the binary release of JClic obtained as a result 
of this build process.

A full operational version of the library is available at:
