Bootstrap files
-----------------

Please place here an "rt.jar" file corresponding to Java 1.5

JClic currently compiles against Java 1.5. As a Java developer, you
probably have installed in your system a newest version of Java.

In order to check your code against the JClic targeted version, it's
advisable to put in this directory the bootstrap classes corresponding
to Java 1.5. These classes are packaged into a file named "rt.jar",
located on the "lib" folder of the Java Runtime Environment 1.5.

This "rt.jar" file is not included with the source code of JClic
because it's a binary not redistibutable.

You can download it from:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/archive-139210.html
(look into "Java SE 5")

This is not a strict requirement. If you don't provide this file,
the compilation will be done against the bootstrap classes of your
current Java version. This will generate a lot of warnings, but
usually no errors. You can safely ignore these warnings.
