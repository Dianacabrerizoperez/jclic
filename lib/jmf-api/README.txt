JMF-API
-----------------------------

This is just an INCOMPLETE, EMPTY and NO-OPERATIONAL implementation of the 
Java Media Framework library, based on the public API available at: 
http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/apidocs

The files contained in this directory tree are used only at compile-time to make 
possible the build process of JClic without external dependencies. They will not be 
compiled, packaged nor included in the binary release of JClic obtained as a result 
of this build process.

A full operational version of the library is available at:
