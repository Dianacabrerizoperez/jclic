JClic: Authoring and playing system for educational activities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compilation instructions:

The current version of JClic compiles with version 1.5 or later of the 
Java Development Toolkit (JDK)

Compilation is done with Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/), version 1.6.5 
or later.

To compile, just open a console, go to the root directory of the JClic source
code (where the build.xml file is located) and invoke "ant".

The JAR files must be signed to be used in applets. A test certificate key
is provided in "keystore/testcert.keystore".
Please don't use code signed with this key in production releases: always 
sign it using your own certificate. For more information, see the document
"keystore/readme.txt"

At the end of the build process, the resulting JAR files will appear into 
the "dist" directory.

To start the programs, copy all the contents of the "dist" directory to an 
appropiate place and enter the following commands:

- To launch JClic:
  java -jar jclic.jar

- To launch JClic author:
  java -jar jclicauthor.jar

- To launch JClic reports:
  java -jar jclicreports.jar
  
- To setup the J2EE version of JClic reports, see:
